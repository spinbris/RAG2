### Introduction

**Query Used**: introduction background context purpose

• Prudent institutions should assess both physical and transition risks within scenarios.
• Seeking input from external experts is important while maintaining internal knowledge.
• Institutions should measure the impact of climate risks on various business obligations.
• Scenario analysis with both short- and long-term time horizons is useful for risk identification.
• Institutions should identify economic sectors with higher or lower exposures to climate risks.
• More advanced quantitative risk metrics may include direct and indirect emissions.
• Institutions should choose analytical approaches appropriate to their circumstances for understanding material climate risks.
• Narrative-driven scenario analysis can be beneficial for institutions lacking data or resources for quantitative assessments.
• Prudent practice involves managing climate risks within written risk management policies and procedures.
• Policies and procedures should clearly articulate roles and responsibilities in managing climate risks.

### Governance

**Query Used**: governance oversight management responsibilities

• The board of an institution is responsible for applying the risk management framework to assess and manage climate risk exposures.
• Senior management should regularly review and make appropriate revisions to the framework, policies, tools, and metrics related to climate risks.
• The board should ensure that adequate resources, skills, and expertise are allocated to manage climate risks effectively.
• Climate risks should be managed within an institution's overall business strategy and risk appetite.
• The board may delegate certain functions related to climate risk management but needs to maintain mechanisms for monitoring delegated authority.

### Risk Management

**Query Used**: risk management assessment monitoring

• Institutions should consider the impact of climate risks on capital adequacy and may use the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) for this purpose.
• Monitoring climate risks should include both qualitative and quantitative approaches, with metrics tailored to the institution's size, business mix, and complexity of operations.
• The board of an APRA-regulated institution is responsible for overseeing the risk management framework, including considering climate risks within existing risk management practices.
• Institutions should establish procedures to provide relevant information on material climate risk exposures to the board and senior management for well-informed decision-making.
• Prudent institutions should evidence the management of climate risks in their risk management policies and procedures, with clear roles and responsibilities outlined for managing climate risks.

### Implementation

**Query Used**: implementation recommendations next steps

• Board responsibilities include assessing and managing climate risk exposures, developing policies, and providing recommendations to the board.
• Institutions should incorporate both physical and transition risks into scenario analysis.
• External experts should be consulted for credible analysis, while also maintaining internal oversight.
• APRA's mandate includes ensuring institutions manage risks and opportunities related to climate change.
• The guide provides guidance to assist institutions in compliance with existing risk management and governance requirements.
