## Summary

This document, CPG229, issued by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) in November 2021, focuses on addressing climate change financial risks for regulated institutions. The guide outlines governance, risk management, policies, procedures, scenario analysis, and disclosure practices related to climate risks. Key findings include the importance of incorporating climate risk analysis in an institution's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and maintaining documentation of scenario analysis and stress testing results. Critical insights highlight the need for board-level understanding and accountability for climate risks, as well as the identification of physical, transition, and liability risks associated with climate change. Recommendations include adopting a narrative-driven approach for scenario analysis, disclosing significant design features in climate risk analysis, and aligning risk management practices with the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Next steps involve communicating material results to senior management, informing business planning and strategy setting, and continually reviewing and updating the institution's climate risk management approach.
