model to evaluate simulations and projections, noting that testing scenarios at the 
extreme ranges is more likely to identify risks. 
43. Where institutions publicly disclose the results of their climate risks scenario analysis or 
stress testing, they should also disclose significant design features and decisions that 
are necessary for stakeholders to be able to effectively interpret the results and compare 
them between institutions.   
44. Useful guidance on conducting scenario selection and analysis to assess the impacts of 
climate risks has been produced by organisations such as the TCFD

22. A prudent institution would seek to understand climate risks and how they may affect its 
business model, including being able to identify material climate risks and assess their 
potential impact on the institution. Scenario analysis, with both a shorter- and longer-
term time horizon, is a useful tool for informing the risk identification process (see 
further discussion on scenario analysis in Paragraphs 37 to 46). 
23. CPS 220 and SPS 220 identify categories of risk that the risk management framework 
must cover at a minimum. Climate risks can be considered within these established risk 
categories. A prudent institution would be able to demonstrate how it determines the 
materiality of climate risk within each of these categories. 
24. A prudent institution would likely seek to identify economic sectors with higher or lower 
exposures to physical and/or transition climate risks. The risk criteria for this 
identification may include a range of factors, such as:
