About this guide 
Prudential practice guides (PPGs) provide guidance on APRA’s view of sound practice in 
particular areas. PPGs frequently discuss legal requirements from legislation, regulations or 
APRA’s prudential standards, but do not themselves create enforceable requirements. 
This PPG aims to assist an APRA-regulated institution in complying with Prudential Standards 
CPS 220 Risk Management (CPS 220), SPS 220 Risk Management (SPS 220), CPS 510 Governance 
(CPS 510), SPS 510 Governance (SPS 510) and, more generally, to outline prudent practices in 
relation to climate change financial risk management. 
In this PPG, the term: 
• ‘climate risks’ refers to the financial risks arising from climate change, including 
physical, transition and liability risks; and 
• ‘APRA-regulated institution’ refers to an authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI), a 
registrable superannuation entity (RSE) licensee (RSE licensee), a general insurer, a life

and targets, and making appropriate revisions;
c) providing recommendations to the board on the institution’s objectives, plans,
strategic options and policies as they relate to climate risks that are assessed to be
mat
erial. This may include the establishment and use of relevant tools, models, and
met
