Scenario analysis 
37. In f ulfilling their obligations under CPS 220, it would be prudent for institutions to develop 
capabilities in climate risk scenario analysis and stress testing, or to have access to 
external scenario analysis and stress testing capabilities. This analysis would inform their 
risk identification over both the shorter- and longer-term. Scenario analysis and stress 
testing for climate risks is a developing area, and APRA expects approaches to evolve and 
mature over time; however, the expectation of future improvements in approach is not a 
justification for delaying its use.
38. APRA expects the use of scenario analysis and stress testing for climate risks to be 
proportionate to an institution’s size, business mix and complexity. In general, larger and 
more complex in
stitutions, with a wider range of business activities, would be expected to 
have more advanced analytical capability. However, depending on its business model, a

model to evaluate simulations and projections, noting that testing scenarios at the 
extreme ranges is more likely to identify risks. 
43. Where institutions publicly disclose the results of their climate risks scenario analysis or 
stress testing, they should also disclose significant design features and decisions that 
are necessary for stakeholders to be able to effectively interpret the results and compare 
them between institutions.   
44. Useful guidance on conducting scenario selection and analysis to assess the impacts of 
climate risks has been produced by organisations such as the TCFD

impact on capital adequacy as a result of climate risks. An institution may choose to use
the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) for this purpose. A

stitution that is not required to complete an ICAAP may benefit from adopting a similar
appro
ach to recording any material exposures and how the assessment of those
ex
posures is considered, for example within stress testing policies and processes.
Risk monitoring 
26. Better practice in monitoring climate risks includes both a qualitative and quantitative
approach, including developing metrics to measure and monitor climate risks
appropriate to an institution’s size, business mix and complexity of business operations.
Such metrics might typically be used, for example, to assess portfolio exposures to
geographical areas and economic sectors with higher or lower climate risk
