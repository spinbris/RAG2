## Summary

• Institutions fulfilling obligations under CPS 220 should develop capabilities in climate risk scenario analysis and stress testing.
• APRA expects the use of scenario analysis and stress testing for climate risks to be proportionate to an institution's size, business mix, and complexity.
• A narrative-driven process is considered useful for incorporating the financial risks of climate change in an institution's ICAAP. 
• Prudent institutions should maintain appropriate documentation of the method and results of climate risk scenario analysis and stress testing.
